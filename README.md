## Description

The group project is spread out over a three week period. During Week 1 project teams will have a kick-off session where participants form teams, work towards defining a specific problem, and then sketch out a solution to solve their identified problem. Week 2 and week 3 will involve development, testing and deployment of their solution.

Project teams must work together to build and deliver a product. Teams will have wide leeway on what they can build, though some possible options are below: 

* E-Commerce website including categories, products, and a checkout
* Full responsive website for a non profit or commercial entity
* Productivity app like a complex To Do Manager, Conversion Calculator, or other tool that fulfills a user need
* A fun game like Wordle, Hangman, Checkers, Memory, Rock Paper Scissors

You must use HTML, CSS, and JS to build your product. And your code must be pushed to GitHub using the classroom repository for the Group Project.

Students will also be assessed on their ability to commit their code to GitHub and activate the GitHub pages service.
